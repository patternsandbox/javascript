# Design Patterns in JavaScript

## Creational Patterns

 These patterns are designed for class instantiation. They can be either class-creation patterns or object-creational patterns. 

### Builder Pattern
>Builder pattern separate the complexities of the creation logic from the final representation.

#### Problem
Imagine a complex object that requires laborious, step-by-step initialization of many fields and nested objects. Such initialization code is usually buried inside a monstrous constructor with lots of parameters. Or even worse: scattered all over the client code. __Ref:__ [Refactoring Guru]
#### Solution
A builder pattern is a design pattern that lets us extract the object construction out of its own class (its representation) so that it can be used for multiple different representations. One advantage to using this pattern is that it lets us build objects with one operation on top of another where we don’t need to call all operations simultaneously, only the ones that are needed to produce a particular output. __Ref:__ [Yash Sharma]

### Factory Pattern
>

#### Problem
undefined
#### Solution
The factory pattern wraps a constructor for different types of objects and returns instances of the objects via a simple API. It makes it easy to create different objects by exposing a simple API that return the specified object type. Ref: __Ref:__ [Babs Craig]

## Structural Patterns

 Designed with regard to a class’s structure and composition. The main goal of most of these patterns is to increase the functionality of the class(es) involved, without changing much of its composition. 

### Decorator Pattern

#### Problem
undefined
#### Solution
undefined

### Facade Pattern
>The Façade pattern provides an interface which shields clients from complex functionality in one or more subsystems.

#### Problem
Imagine that you must make your code work with a broad set of objects that belong to a sophisticated library or framework. Ordinarily, you’d need to initialize all of those objects, keep track of dependencies, execute methods in the correct order, and so on. As a result, the business logic of your classes would become tightly coupled to the implementation details of 3rd-party classes, making it hard to comprehend and maintain. __Ref:__ [Refactoring Guru]
#### Solution
A facade is a class that provides a simple interface to a complex subsystem which contains lots of moving parts. A facade might provide limited functionality in comparison to working with the subsystem directly. However, it includes only those features that clients really care about. __Ref:__ [Refactoring Guru]

## Behavioural Patterns

 Behavioural patterns are designed depending on how one class communicates with others.

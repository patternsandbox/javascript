# Design Patterns in JavaScript

## Creational Patterns

### Builder Pattern
>Builder pattern separate the complexities of the creation logic from the final representation.

#### Problem
Imagine a complex object that requires laborious, step-by-step initialization of many fields and nested objects. Such initialization code is usually buried inside a monstrous constructor with lots of parameters. Or even worse: scattered all over the client code. [refactoring.guru]
#### Solution
A builder pattern is a design pattern that lets us extract the object construction out of its own class (its representation) so that it can be used for multiple different representations. One advantage to using this pattern is that it lets us build objects with one operation on top of another where we donâ€™t need to call all operations simultaneously, only the ones that are needed to produce a particular output.

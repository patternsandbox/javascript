# Builder Pattern
Builder pattern separates the `construction` of complex object which involve `computing multiple sequential operations` from its `representation`. 
So that we can use the same construction process over and over to create different representations.

Example: 

Let's take creating a Car object as an example. Now, a Car can have many optional fields such as body style, make, model, color, navigation, camera, etc ...
which makes it a complex object to create for different cars. One would like a car with navigation and others with camera.
